I completed my BSc in Psychology at the University of Bucharest, where I focused on empathy and the theory of minds for my thesis. Currently, I am pursuing a Cognitive Neuroscience MSc, with a specialisation in perception, action and decision making. This academic year (2025-2026), I am writing my thesis under the supervision of Matteo Maran and Hans Rutger Bosker, exploring via EEG experiments (MMN paradigm) the neural basis of the manual McGurk effect.
