Giulio Severijnen did his PhD at the Donders Center for Cognition [DCC], part of the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl), Nijmegen, The Netherlands (2020-2024). His PhD project was supervised by [Prof. James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/mcqueen-j/), [Dr. Hans Rutger Bosker]({{< ref "../admin" >}}), and Dr. Ashley Lewis. His research investigated between-talker and within-talker variability in prosody production, with a specific focus on lexical stress and speech rate. He also tested how listeners flexibly adapt to this variability in order to successfully comprehend different talkers. The project was funded through a 'Donders Internal PhD Round' grant, awarded to Prof. James McQueen, Dr. Hans Rutger Bosker, and Dr. Ashley Lewis. After his PhD, Giulio took up a postdoc position with Prof. Davide Crepaldi at the Language, Learning and Reading lab (SISSA, Trieste, Italy).
