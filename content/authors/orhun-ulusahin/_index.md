Orhun Uluşahin is a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl) [MPI], Nijmegen, The Netherlands. His supervisors are [Prof. Antje S. Meyer](https://www.mpi.nl/people/meyer-antje), [Prof. James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/mcqueen-j/), and [Dr. Hans Rutger Bosker](https://www.hrbosker.netlify.app). His project targets the production-perception interface, using phonetic convergence as the main paradigm. Specifically, he tests whether familiarity with a talker modulates the extent to which interlocutors converge towards each other on a phonetic level.
