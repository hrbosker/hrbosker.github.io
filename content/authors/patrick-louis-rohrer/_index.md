Patrick Louis Rohrer is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Donders Center for Cognition [DCC], part of the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl), Nijmegen, The Netherlands. He is a member of the **Speech Perception in Audiovisual Communication** [SPEAC] research group, funded by the ERC Starting Grant 'HearingHands' [101040276; PI: Hans Rutger Bosker] that started in September 2022. His project within this research grant investigates gesture-speech synchrony in a set of typologically diverse languages in terms of prosodic structure. Additionally, his project assesses the effects of this synchrony on audiovisual speech perception.
