If you'd like to meet in person, **my office 02.374** is in the [Maria Montessori building](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/the-campus/buildings-and-spaces/maria-montessori-building) of the Radboud University.

Enter through the main entrance and immediately take the stairs (right in front of you) to the first floor. Walk past the coffee bar (on your right hand side) to the other side of the building and then take the stairs (on your right hand side) to the second floor. Upon reaching the top of the stairs, continue ahead but don't go up the next flight of stairs in front of you. Stay on the second floor and walk past those stairs on your right. At the end of this corridor, you'll see staircases behind glass doors. Just to the right of them, you'll find a (slightly hidden) automatic door (i.e., opposite room 02.610). Press the button to open it and you'll find my room 02.374 halfway along the corridor, on your left hand side.
