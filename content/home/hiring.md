We currently have two open postdoc positions available!

## [PD1] Testing Cross-Linguistic Gesture-Speech Alignment with Motion-Tracking

The first postdoc will run a large-scale cross-linguistic investigation of gesture-speech synchrony in a set of nine typologically diverse languages using 2D motion-tracking. All the details can be found at the link below but also feel free [to get in touch](./contact) for more information.

## [PD2] Testing Audiovisual Gesture-Speech Integration in MEG

The second postdoc project is more neuro-focused, testing audiovisual gesture-speech integration (i.e., the [manual McGurk effect](.\demos\manual-mcgurk)) in the MEG scanner using Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT). The aim is to test both typically developing individuals as well as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who are known to demonstrate impairments in prosody perception. All the details can be found at the link below but also feel free [to get in touch](./contact) for more information.
