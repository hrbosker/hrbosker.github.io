We supervise BA students writing their thesis in the **BA Psychology program** of Radboud University. This concerns the Research Project 3/Bachelor Thesis course (RP3/BT; Dutch: *Onderzoeksproject 3, OP3*), see [SOW-PSB3RS55E](https://www.ru.nl/osiris-student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?cursus=SOW-PSB3RS55E&selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2023&taal=en&minimal=J) for full description.

Students run a self-defined experiment as a group, with each student addressing a unique research question. These typically involve online web experiments, run on [Gorilla](https://gorilla.sc). RP3/BT projects last a single semester and add up to 6 ECs. During this time, you gain important research skills (e.g., see info box at top of page), work closely with SPEAC members, and experience the research cycle from 'plan to paper'. If successful, students may serve as co-authors on academic output (e.g., journal articles, proceedings papers, presentations) that stem from their project.
