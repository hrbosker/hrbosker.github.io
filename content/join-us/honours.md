We supervise B2 and B3 Honours students from the **BA Psychology program** of Radboud University. First-year BA Psychology students can apply for the [General Psychology Honours Program](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/events/general-psychology). If selected, you get to run independent research projects in the 2nd and 3rd years of your studies. These are 1-year projects, first in a group (B2), then individually (B3), that even come with small research funding (e.g., 500 euros per B2 group). Upon completion of all elements of the Honours Program, you will receive the Honours certificate. And if the project is successful, you may serve as co-author on a journal article, proceedings paper, or presentation describing the project.
