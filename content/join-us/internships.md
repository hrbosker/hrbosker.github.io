Internships are independent, tailor-made, student-led research projects of ca. 6 months. Students from the **Cognitive Neuroscience MA program** of Radboud University can take the **Capita Selecta** elective course (see [SOW-DGCN40](https://www.ru.nl/osiris-student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?cursus=SOW-DGCN40&selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2024&taal=en&minimal=J) for full description) and receive 6 ECs for a completed internship project. You become a member of the SPEAC group, go through the lab check-in procedure, join and present in lab meetings, and - most importantly - **run your own study from 'plan to paper'**! If successful, you may serve as co-author on academic output (e.g., journal articles, proceedings papers, presentations) that stem from the project.
