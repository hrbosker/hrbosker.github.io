## Internally funded positions

I currently have **no vacancies** for postdoc or PhD positions in my group.

Should new opportunities come up, they will be posted here as well as on the Radboud University [job opportunities page](https://www.ru.nl/en/working-at/job-opportunities).

## Externally funded positions

I am happy to host visiting postdocs and PhDs on external funding if they work on a research project that is closely related to the [research interests](../research) of the group. Keep in mind that living and working in Nijmegen is expensive. The external funding source should therefore meet several requirements set by the Dutch government (e.g., to apply for a Dutch visa) and Radboud University. Specifically:

- A gross salary reaching a sum total of 1,700 euro net/month
- A "declaration/contract devoid of inhumane terms" for provision of the funding (assessed by Radboud University's Knowledge Security Advisory Team).
- Excellent English proficiency for academic communication and writing
- A feasible project with a pre-specified timeplan and clear goals

If you think you meet these requirements, feel free to [get in touch](/contact)! When you do so, please send me an academic CV as well as background information on the points above.

Unfortunately, the European Erasmus+ Program and the Chinese CSC Program generally do not meet these financial requirements. Therefore, requests for hosting visiting researchers or students who are funded by Erasmus+ or CSC alone are unlikely to be granted.

Finding housing in Nijmegen can be challenging, especially for internationals. If you're planning a (short-term) move, it's important to start your search early, as availability is limited and waitlists can be long. For short-term accommodation (up to one year), you might consider the [SSHN guesthouse](https://www.sshn.nl/international-students-staff/staff/our-guesthouse#/) or other temporary options through resources like [ExpatDesk Nijmegen](https://www.expatdesknijmegen.nl/). Just keep in mind that spots fill up quicklyâ€”so the sooner you look, the better.
