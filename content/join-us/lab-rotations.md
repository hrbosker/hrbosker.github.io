Lab rotations are short-term introductions to the various research groups of the Donders Institute. They form part of the **Cognitive Neuroscience MA program** (CNS) of Radboud University (see [SOW-DGCN04](https://www.ru.nl/osiris-student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?cursus=SOW-DGCN04&selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2024&taal=en&minimal=J) for full description).

CNS students are required to complete 3 lab rotations of 28 hours (1 EC) each to taste what doing-science is like at the Donders Institute. You join lab meetings, go through the lab check-in procedure, and help out with several kinds of research-related tasks, like testing participants, analyzing data, or supporting data curation. It is completed by writing a 2-page summary of an individual lab rotation.

If you're interested in doing a lab rotation in the SPEAC group, do [get in touch!](/contact) Who knows: maybe you get hooked to doing speech science and continue running a 6-month [internship](#internships) or a 1-year [thesis project](#ma-thesis)?!?
