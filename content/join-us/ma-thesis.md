Students in the **Cognitive Neuroscience MA program** of Radboud University complete their degree by performing a 1-year thesis project (45 ECs, see [SOW-DGCN05](https://www.ru.nl/osiris-student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?cursus=SOW-DGCN05&selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2024&taal=en&minimal=J) for full description). This involves running an independent, tailor-made, student-led research project from start to finish. Experimental techniques may include behavioral paradigms, eye-tracking, and/or neuroimaging (e.g., EEG, MEG, fMRI). You become a member of the SPEAC group, go through the lab check-in procedure, and join and present in lab meetings. If successful, you in principle serve as co-author on any academic output that stems from the project (e.g., journal articles, proceedings papers, presentations).
