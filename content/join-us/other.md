**@students-from-abroad:**

Unfortunately, the European Erasmus+ Program and the Chinese CSC Program are generally insufficient to meet the financial requirements of Radboud University (listed above). Therefore, requests for hosting international interns that are funded by Erasmus+ or CSC alone are unlikely to be granted.
