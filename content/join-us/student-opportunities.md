Students regularly contribute to our research in various projects. If the project is successful, they may also serve as co-authors on journal articles and/or proceedings papers describing the study outcomes. We primarily host student projects from the **Cognitive Neuroscience (CNS) master program** and the **Psychology bachelor program** of Radboud University. These include [BA theses](#ba-thesis), [BA honours projects](#honours), [lab rotations](#lab-rotations), [internships](#internships), and [MA theses](#ma-thesis), specified below. Individual requests to host such projects are typically accepted: just [send me an email](/contact/) and let's meet!

Examples of student projects include:

:robot: 

For their [BA thesis](#ba-thesis), BA Psychology students ran a self-made web experiment testing if **AI-generated avatars** can change speech perception (*spoiler: they do*)

:brain:

For her [BA thesis](#ba-thesis), a Biomedical Sciences student ran **an EEG study**, testing if 'out-of-sync' beat gestures (i.e., falling on unstressed syllables) lead to an N400 response in the brain.

:earth_americas:

For the [General Psychology Honours Program](#honours), BA students ran their own web experiment, testing the **manual McGurk effect in English**.

:film_strip:

For the **CNS program**, MA students performed [lab rotations](#lab-rotations) (short lab intro's), joining in lab meetings, testing participants, searching for open data, and labelling videos.

:loud_sound:

An MA student from the **CNS program** ran a self-defined [Capita Selecta internship](#internships), first replicating an earlier study of ours, and then extending it by adding noise to the speech stimuli.
