My goal for the SPEAC group as a whole is to foster an environment of scientific excellence
and personal development that supports every lab member in reaching their full potential (and
having fun while weâ€™re at it). Anyone is welcome to join!

If you are...
- excited about running speech :speech_balloon:, moving lips :lips:, and expressive hands :wave:
- reliable, consistent, and eager to learn
- willing to work hard, think critically, and be creative
- happy to support others and share your work

... then read on!

Many projects in the SPEAC group involve things like: audio-editing in [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), video-editing by calling [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), video annotations in [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/), running your experiment in [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/), doing stats in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), plotting your data using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), sharing your code in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), archiving your data on [OSF](https://osf.io/), managing references in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), with bonus points for writing your paper in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Prospective lab members should be prepared to familiarize themselves with these tools. The learning curve can be a little steep but it's well worth it! If however acquiring skills like these isn't compatible with your goals or interests, then the SPEAC group is probably not a good fit for you.
