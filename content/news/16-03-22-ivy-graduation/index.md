## Congratulations!

Ivy wrote [her MA thesis](https://theses.ubn.ru.nl/handle/123456789/14258) on lexical stress perception in noise. She tested whether listeners are flexible in how they weigh auditory and visual articulatory cues to lexical stress when listening is hard. Her thesis results showed convincingly that people weigh the visual cues to lexical stress more heavily when the speech is increasingly masked by loud background babble.

We're happy to see Ivy graduate but we're also sad to see her leave the group. We'll certainly miss the maple syrup biscuits and soesjes at lab meetings. Still, she won't stray far: she's taken up a position as project coordinator at the Multimodal Language Department of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.

Congratulations, Ivy!
