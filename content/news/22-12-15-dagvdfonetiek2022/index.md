## Open to all!

The 'Dag van de Fonetiek' 2022 will take place on **Friday Dec 16, 2022**, in the Sweelinckzaal at Drift 21, Utrecht, The Netherlands. It is an event celebrating everything 'speechy' and is free and open to all: members, non-members, scientists, students, anyone! This year, you can hear {{< mention "ronny-bujok" >}} talk about whether beat gestures recalibrate lexical stress perception, and {{< mention "orhun-ulusahin" >}} has some intriguing results about how listeners track a talker's pitch!

See https://www.nvfw.org/ for the full program. We hope to see you there!
