**Patrick joined the group in May 2023 to work on a cross-linguistic comparison of gesture-speech temporal alignment in production and perception.**

## Timing gestures and prosody

{{< mention "patrick-louis-rohrer" >}} will be in charge of Work Package 1 of the HearingHands ERC Starting Grant. This WP1 compares the temporal alignment of gestures and speech in languages with different prosodic regimes, including free-stress, fixed-stress, and lexical-tone languages. Next to this production strand, a perception strand investigates how the timing of seemingly meaningless gestures contributes to low-level speech perception in these same languages.

Glad to have you on the team, Patrick!
