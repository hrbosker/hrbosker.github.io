**Matteo joined the group in June 2023 to test the neural correlates of audiovisual integration of gestural timing and spoken prosody, as well as their alteration in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**

## Audiovisual integration

{{< mention "matteo-maran" >}} will be in charge of Work Package 2 of the HearingHands ERC Starting Grant. This WP2 tests the audiovisual integration of gestural timing with spoken prosody using electrophysiological methods. A key aim of WP2 is to assess how this integration may be altered in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Happy to have you on board, Matteo!
