**Chengjia joined the group in Sept 2023 to test how the timing of hand gestures influences speech perception in more naturalistic listening conditions.**

## When listening is tough

{{< mention "chengjia-ye" >}} will run Work Package 3 of the HearingHands ERC Starting Grant, together with [Prof. James McQueen](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/mcqueen-j/) (promotor) and [Dr. Hans Rutger Bosker]({{< ref "../../authors/admin" >}}). This WP3 tests how beat gestures influence speech perception in more naturalistic listening conditions. We will assess whether the communicative relevance of a gesture influences the manual McGurk effect by making use of talking avatars, how the integration of gestural timing with spoken prosody varies depending on the saliency of the visual/auditory cues, and whether listeners adapt to variability in gesture-speech alignment.

Great to have you on the team, Chengjia!
