## What are they about?

Most of our submissions concerned the temporal synchrony between hand gestures and speech in different languages. [Rohrer, Hong, and Bosker (2024)](/publication/rohrer-hong-etal-2024-speechprosody) is one of the first studies to test how gestures time with speech in a lexical tone language, namely Mandarin. [Rohrer, Bujok, Van Maastricht, and Bosker (2024)](/publication/rohrer-bujok-etal-2024-speechprosody) demonstrates that seeing a gesture can change where you hear the stress in Spanish, extending the 'manual McGurk effect' originally observed in Dutch to Spanish. [Cos, Bujok, and Bosker (2024)](/publication/cos-etal-2024-speechprosody) reran an earlier manual McGurk experiment with the same participants over 1.5 years later, successfully replicating earlier work at the group level but reporting a weak correlation of the by-participant effect sizes in the two identical experiments. [Maran and Bosker (2024)](/publication/maran-bosker-2024-speechprosody) presents a mini-test of the manual McGurk effect, allowing reliable assessment of gesture-speech integration in under 10 minutes! Finally, [Uluşahin, Bosker, McQueen, and Meyer (2024)](/publication/ulusahin-etal-2024-speechprosody) reports two experiments investigating how knowledge about a given talker's typical pitch influences subsequent voiceless (!) fricative perception.

## Is that it?

If that wasn't enough, there's also two submissions accepted for Speech Prosody 2024 that didn't stem from work performed in our group, but that were co-authored by current group members. These are **Severijnen, Gärtner, Walther, and McQueen (2024)** and **Ye and Boersma (2024)**. Congratulations!
