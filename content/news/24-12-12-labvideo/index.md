## Lab facilities at the Donders Centre for Cognition

The [Donders Centre for Cognition](https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/faculty-of-social-sciences/donders-centre-for-cognition), part of the larger [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute), have a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgVvHZ5DK6updb0CIiyPQRCgeSjv0pyP) where they present their lab facilities. These are also the facilities we use in our research, focusing on audiovisual speech perception. In this latest video, many SPEAC members appear, demonstrating some of our methods and techniques. Enjoy!
