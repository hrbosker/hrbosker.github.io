## When the beat drops

Ronny's thesis is entitled "When the beat drops: How beat gesture alignment with speech affects word recognition". It presents an impressive collection of studies, using a range of experimental paradigms, including eye-tracking, recalibration, and lexical decision. Together, they demonstrate that simple rhythmic hand movements can have an immediate, lasting, and impactful influence on spoken word recognition. No surprise that Ronny did a great job in defending this body of work.

Many SPEAC members came to support Ronny at this important event. It's been a joy and a pleasure to have been a part of Ronny's PhD project (as co-promotor), together with Prof. Antje Meyer (promotor). But we're also happy that this was no goodbye event: Ronny's just around the corner in the Erasmus building, working on his postdoc position at the CLS.
