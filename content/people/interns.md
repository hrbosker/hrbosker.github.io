Students regularly contribute to our research in the form of BA/MA theses, lab rotations, internships, honours projects, or as student-assistants. Current student projects include:

- **Yuting Hong** (Leiden University) is running an internship looking at audiovisual prominence in tone languages Mandarin and Cantonese;
- **Sarah Kapp** (Freiburg University) is writing her MA thesis on a project testing how people tune into a particular talker's habitual speech rate;
- **Renske Rötjes** and **Anna Schreurs** are writing their BA theses on how different artificially generated visual cues (e.g., avatars) influence spoken word recognition;
- **Tim Kolleth**, **Fenna Seebregts**, and **Lorin Wolfs** are running a BA honours project testing how the manual McGurk effect works in English;
- **Silvia Dragan** and **Kelly Karremans** are doing individual lab rotations in the group;
- **Beatrice Caddeo** is supporting research in the position of student-assistant;
- **Roos Rossen** is speer-heading a one-year team science project aiming to engage the larger public with our research through the Donders Citylab.

And these are the names of bright students who in the past wrote their BA/MA thesis in the group or who did an internship or temporary research project with us. You will find some of their names appear as authors on [our publications]({{< ref "../publication" >}}).
