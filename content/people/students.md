Students regularly contribute to our research in the form of BA/MA theses, lab rotations, internships, honours projects, or as student-assistants. Current student projects include:

- **Arezu-Alexia Vaezei** (MA student, CNS) is running her thesis project with us, testing the manual McGurk effect using the MMN paradigm in EEG;
- **Jeroen Boon**, **Charlotte Kuijpers**, **Rosalie Nillesen**, **Nastia Schamanska**, and **Salena Sinha** are running a BA thesis project, testing how a range of different visual signals influence audiovisual stress perception;
- **Marit van Rossum** is running a B3 Honours project with us (resulting in her BA thesis), testing the manual McGurk effect in adverse listening conditions;
- **Jet Lambers** and **Ewa Wawrynek** are supporting our research as student-assistants;
- **Roos Rossen** is speerheading a team science project aiming to engage the larger public with our research through the Donders Citylab.

And these are the names of bright students who in the past wrote their BA/MA thesis in the group or who did an internship project with us. You will find some of their names appear as authors on [our publications]({{< ref "../publication" >}}).
