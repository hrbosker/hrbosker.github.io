Next to the students with individual projects listed above, there are also many other students who support the research. For instance, there are MA students from the Cognitive Neuroscience program who do a short-term lab rotation in the group. And BA students from the Psychology program do their thesis projects in small teams on topics related to audiovisual speech perception. We're very happy with all their contributions. If you're interested in getting involved too, why not check out the link below:
