abstract: Individuals vary in how they produce speech. This variability affects both the segments (vowels  and consonants) and the suprasegmental properties of their speech (prosody). Previous literature  has demonstrated that listeners can adapt to variability in how different talkers pronounce the  segments of speech. This study shows that listeners can also adapt to variability in how talkers  produce lexical stress. Experiment 1 demonstrates a selective adaptation effect in lexical stress  perception- repeatedly hearing Dutch trochaic words biased perception of a subsequent lexical stress continuum towards more iamb responses. Experiment 2 demonstrates a recalibrationeffect in lexical stress perception- when ambiguous suprasegmental cues to lexical stress were disambiguated by lexical orthographic context as signaling a trochaic word in an exposure phase, Dutch participants categorized a subsequent test continuum as more trochee-like. Moreover, the selective adaptation and recalibration effects generalized to novel words, not encountered during exposure. Together, the experiments demonstrate that listeners also flexibly adapt to variability in the suprasegmental properties of speech, thus expanding our understanding of the utility of listener adaptation in speech perception. Moreover, the combined outcomes speak for an architecture of spoken word recognition involving abstract prosodic representations at a prelexical level of analysis.
