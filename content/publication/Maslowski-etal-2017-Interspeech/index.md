abstract: 'Speech rate is known to modulate perception of temporally ambiguous speech sounds. For instance, a vowel may be perceived as short when the immediate speech context is slow, but as long when the context is fast. Yet, effects of long-term tracking of speech rate are largely unexplored. Two experiments tested whether long-term tracking of rate influences perception of the temporal Dutch vowel contrast /A/-/a:/. In Experiment 1, one low-rate group listened to ‘neutral’ rate speech from talker A and to slow speech from talker B. Another high-rate group was exposed to the same neutral speech from A, but to fast speech from B. Between-group comparison of the ‘neutral’ trials revealed that the low-rate group reported a higher proportion of /a:/ in A’s ‘neutral’ speech, indicating that A sounded faster when B was slow. Experiment 2 tested whether one’s own speech rate also contributes to effects of long-term tracking of rate. Here, talker B’s speech was replaced by playback of participants’ own fast or slow speech. No evidence was found that one’s own voice affected perception of talker A in larger speech contexts. These results carry implications for our understanding of the mechanisms involved in rate-dependent speech perception and of dialogue.'
