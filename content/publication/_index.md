## **Fulltexts**
All our publications are freely accessible to all. Most are openly available from the publisher's website (*gold open access*; see **[DOI]** links below]), the remainder is made available here (*green open access*; see **[PDF]** links below). In some cases, only the author's version can be shared (i.e., before copy-editing).

## **Open Data**
Since 2018, all our papers have open data, materials, and analysis scripts available from the Open Science Framework (OSF; see [https://osf.io/h93n8](https://osf.io/h93n8)) or other data repositories. See the **[Dataset]** links below.

## **Preprints**
Preprints are early versions of scientific papers that have *not yet been formally peer-reviewed*. Hence, they are subject to change, should not be reported as conclusive, and are listed separately from peer-reviewed publications below. This also means we're open to feedback and suggestions from interested readers. [Send us your comments!](../../contact)
