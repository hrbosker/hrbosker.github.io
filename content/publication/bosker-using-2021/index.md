abstract: 'Many studies of speech perception assess the intelligibility of spoken
  sentence stimuli by means of transcription tasks (‘type out what you hear’). The
  intelligibility of a given stimulus is then often expressed in terms of percentage
  of words correctly reported from the target sentence. Yet scoring the participants’
  raw responses for words correctly identified from the target sentence is a time-consuming
  task, and hence resource-intensive. Moreover, there is no consensus among speech
  scientists about what specific protocol to use for the human scoring, limiting the
  reliability of human scores. The present paper evaluates various forms of fuzzy
  string matching between participants’ responses and target sentences, as automated
  metrics of listener transcript accuracy. We demonstrate that one particular metric,
  the Token Sort Ratio, is a consistent, highly efficient, and accurate metric for
  automated assessment of listener transcripts, as evidenced by high correlations
  with human-generated scores (best correlation: r = 0.940) and a strong relationship
  to acoustic markers of speech intelligibility. Thus, fuzzy string matching provides
  a practical tool for assessment of listener transcript accuracy in large-scale speech
  intelligibility studies. See https://tokensortratio.netlify.app for an online implementation.'
