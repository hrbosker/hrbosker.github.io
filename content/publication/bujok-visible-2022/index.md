abstract: Producing lexical stress leads to visible changes on the face, such as longer
  duration and greater size of the opening of the mouth. Research suggests that these
  visual cues alone can inform participants about which syllable carries stress (i.e.,
  lipreading silent videos). This study aims to determine the influence of visual
  articulatory cues on lexical stress perception in more naturalistic audiovisual
  settings.
