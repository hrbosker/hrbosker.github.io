 abstract = {The present study examined two acoustic cues in the production of lexical stress in Dutch: spectral tilt and overall intensity. Sluijter and Van Heuven (1996) reported that spectral tilt is a more reliable cue to stress than intensity. However, that study included only a small number of talkers (10) and only syllables with the vowels /aː/ and /ɔ/.},
