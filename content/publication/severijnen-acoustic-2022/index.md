abstract: 'The present study examined two acoustic cues in the production of lexical
  stress in Dutch: spectral tilt and overall intensity. Sluijter and Van Heuven (1996)
  reported that spectral tilt is a more reliable cue to stress than intensity. However,
  that study included only a small number of talkers (10) and only syllables with
  the vowels /aː/ and /ɔ/.'
