The SPEAC research group develops and distributes **speech corpora** and **research tools** that can facilitate research in the speech sciences. In addition, we openly share the **scripts** we write for such software packages like *Praat* and *R*. We also provide some **templates** that we find useful when having to come up with the umptieth title page, cover letter, or informed consent form. Finally, we point people to the many **other resources** that we frequently use in our research ourselves that others have publicly shared.

*Go ahead and explore!*
