The SPEAC lab develops and distributes **speech corpora** and **research tools** that can facilitate research in the speech sciences. In addition, we openly share the **scripts** we write to generate, analyze, and manipulate speech. We also have some **how to's** that provide some guidance and templates that we find useful when having to come up with the umptieth title page, cover letter, or informed consent form. We have also designed courses and tutorials on a range of topics, openly sharing all **course materials**. Finally, we point people to the many **other resources** that we frequently use in our research ourselves that others have publicly shared.

*Go ahead and explore!*
