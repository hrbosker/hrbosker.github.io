This course formed part of the [LOT Summer School 2024](https://lotschool.nl/events/lot-summer-school-2024/). The aim of this 5-day course was to reveal the central role that prosody plays in low-level speech perception and spoken word recognition.

## Course description

Prosody in spoken communication generally refers to those aspects of speech that fall outside the segmental information about consonants and vowels (e.g., intonation, stress, rhythm). Still, this course will describe how suprasegmental prosody and segmental cues in speech are tightly interconnected. As such, it aims to reveal the central role that prosody plays in low-level speech perception and spoken word recognition. Each lecture targets a different processing mechanism by which prosody impacts speech perception, including general-auditory normalization, neural speech tracking, prosody-guided prediction, talker-specific learning, as well as audiovisual integration of multisensory cues to prosody. Thus, prosody - in all its different forms and appearances - is a potent factor in speech perception, determining which words and speech sounds we hear.
