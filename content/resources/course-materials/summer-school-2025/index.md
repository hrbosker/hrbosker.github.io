## Course description

Human conversations involve much more than just exchanging sounds: we move, nod, and gesture to the rhythm of our speech. In this course, I'll introduce some of the methods in the study of multimodal communication, focusing on gesture-speech synchrony from both a production perspective (how do we time our gestures to our speech?) and perception (how does a (mis)aligned gesture change what we hear?). But the best way to grasp these methods is to apply them yourselves! Therefore, we will run our very own gesture-speech integration experiment during this course. So don't forget to bring your (fully charged) laptop!
