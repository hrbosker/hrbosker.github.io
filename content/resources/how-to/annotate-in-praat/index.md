We'll cover making TextGrid annotations in Praat. We'll read .wav files in Praat, create an empty TextGrid with a single tier, add boundaries delimiting individual words in the recording, and save the annotations to a TextGrid file.

{{< spoiler text="*Why is it called Praat anyway?*" >}}
*Praat* was created by Paul Boersma and David Weenink, two Dutch speech scientists from Amsterdam. The Dutch word 'praat' [/pra:t/](https://translate.google.nl/?sl=nl&tl=en&text=praat&op=translate) is the [imperative form](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/papers/speakUnspeakPraat_glot2001.pdf) of the verb 'to speak' (so *"speak!"*).
