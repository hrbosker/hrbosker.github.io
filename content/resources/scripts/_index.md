## Scripting in Praat

Over the years, Praat has had three types of syntax:
- three types of syntax: `some code`
- use PraatVSCode
- how-to will follow soon
```
this is a block of code
and a second line
```

*Not finding what you were looking for?* There are various other webpages with really useful Praat scripts available online. Three particularly useful ones are:
- Vocal plugin
- Matt Winn
- Holger Mitterer
